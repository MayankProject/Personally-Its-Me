YOU DO **NOT** NEED TO USE **React**, **Angular**, **Vue** or the **two-minutes-ago-released, overly complicated JavaScript library**  
just to make a **landing page** with a **text and a button** on it. Maybe learn how to write **actual code** instead of injecting your app with a bloated **motherf\*ckin'** library for every minor **f\*ckin'** thing.
